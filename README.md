A real-time facial emotion detection system that uses deep learning to classify human emotions based on facial expressions. This project aims to enhance Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), support sentiment analysis, and monitor behavioral patterns.

## 🔍 Features

- 🎥 Real-time webcam-based emotion detection
- 😀 Classifies emotions like **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprised**, **Neutral**, and more
- 🧠 Deep Learning powered (CNN/ResNet-based model)
- 📊 Clean UI for emotion display and confidence level
- 💡 Can be integrated into chatbots, feedback systems, or smart surveillance

🔗 [Facial Emotion Detection - Live Demo](https://facial-emotion-detection-bowv.vercel.app/)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
- **Web Framework:** Flask (or similar for backend, if used)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), optionally Flask or FastAPI (Backend)

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Face Detection** using Haar cascades from OpenCV.
2. **Preprocessing** the detected face (grayscale, resize).
3. **Emotion Classification** using a trained CNN/ResNet model.
4. **Output Rendering** on the UI in real time.
